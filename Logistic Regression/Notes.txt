Logistic Regression: It is a supervised learning algorithm which is used to solve 
classification porblems. This algorithm help to calculate the probabilities of the 
given value weather it belong to the specific class or not.
If the probability is more than 50% then only the value assign to a praticular class 
else value is assign to other class.
Logistic Regression also act as a binary classifier.

Working wiht Logistic model: In this model we will be calculating the probabilities
where the values lie between 0 and 1 only.
Imagine that you are calculating the probabilities with the help of Linear Regression,
then the probability values may range will be less than 0 or greater than 1 which may 
make any sense.
To calculate the probabilities in Logistic Regression we will be using a function called
SIGMOID function.
Mathematically representation of Logistic Regression is 1/ (1 + e^-t)
Graphical representation is shown below:

The main purpose using the sigmoid fucntion is that it ranges its boundery values between
0 to 1. Thus its useful for calculating Logistic function.
For calculating the derivative function of the logistic function is easy than other function
which is useful durning gradient desent fucntion.

** Cost Function of Logistic regression is Logloss.**

Logloss: It is the most important classification metrics based on probabilities.
         For any given problem a lower Logloss value means better predictions.
         LogLoss is the negative average of the log of corrected predicted probabilities for each instance. 
         Simple formula = LogLoss = -1/n(submassion(log(pi))
         
         Formula: link given below:

** Multinomial Logsitic Regression **
Number of labels are more than 2
Logic is simple:
1. we train our logistic model for each class and calculate the probabilities and specify that 
the label belong to the specific class.
2. Once all the model is trained we predict the new value class by choosing that class for which 
the probability is maximum.

Learning rate: It is the algorithm to find the best possible hypothesis for the best parameterizarion
where the less error is observaed.
Minimizing the error using batch-gradient desent.
For calculation look for images

Classification Model evaluation:

Confussion metrics: Image of confusion metrics look like:

Meaning for each terms:
1. True Positive (TP): From the model the output predicte is positive when it is actually positive.
2. True negative (TN): From the model the output predicted is negative when it is actually negative.
3. False Positive (FP: From the model the output predicted is positive when it is actually negative.
4. False negative (FN):From the model the output predicted is negative when it is actually positive.

Accuracy = (TP + TN)/ (TP+TN+FP+FN)
Recall or sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN)
Precession = TP/(TP+FP)
F1 score = 2 * (Precession * Recall)/ Precession + Recall

AUC AND ROC: 
ROC --> (Reciver Operator Characteristic):
we know that the classification algorithm works on the concept of probabilities of occourence of 
the possible outcomes.
probability lie between 0 and 1.

But when we are working with classification we will get the output between 0 and 1, then what 
value to be selected.
To select the value the Threshold is used.
Note: A Threshold value is set and any probability value below the Threshold is negative outcomesand 
anything more than Threshold is positive.
example: If Threshold = 0.5 then above 0.5 is marked as 1 and below 0.5 is marked as 0.

AUC --> (Area under curve):
It help to choose the best fit model amongst the model for which we have plotted the ROC curve.
The best model is the one which covers the mazimum area under the curve.
